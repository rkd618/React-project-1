1) Jsx - Is not HTML in Js ,Jsx is like a HTML not a HTML 
html like Syntax (Jsx is more closer to XML)

const heading = () => {
    return <h1>Hellow React<h1/> ;
}

const Heading = () => (<h1>Hellow React</h1>)

jsx sort the html tag like br etc
</title>  == <title></title>

In useState  function does not neet to return because we dont need any value or calculation just for some functionality
